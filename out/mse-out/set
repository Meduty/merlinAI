		At the beginning of your end step, if you drew no cards this turn, exile the top card of your library face down. You may look at and play cards exiled with Chamber of Forgotten Echoes.
		Whenever an opponent discards a card or a creature dies, you may put a card exiled with Chamber of Forgotten Echoes into your hand.
		If Chamber of Forgotten Echoes would leave the battlefield, exile all cards exiled with it.

		Draw two cards. If you have no cards in hand after drawing this way, draw three additional cards instead. Then, if your hand is empty, you may exile Echoes of Tranquil Void from your graveyard. If you do, return a card from your graveyard to your hand.
		When thoughts fade and memory whispers, all that remains is silent clarity.
